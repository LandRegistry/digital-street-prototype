                                which sets out the terms of the sale. It specifies the rights and duties of you and the buyer.
                                It needs to be signed by both parties
                                before it's legally binding.

                                The property needs to be registered in the buyer's name, with HM land registry.
                                Once this is done, the ownership of the property will be legally transferred from you to the buyer.
